# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I'm a 22 year old programmer and rhythm-game enthusiast from Manchester.

Professionally, I work full-time with Python, TypeScript and dabble in some infrastructure stuff.
In my free time, I use TypeScript (Svelte, preferably) but perhaps more interestingly I'm working on a secret project involving a rather large amount of Rust. I'll have more to talk about in the near future.

Outside of programming, I read quite a bit, listen to a lot of music and boulder (poorly).

## Other Stuff

- Editor: [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) with far too many modifications, `vim` when I'm stuck in a terminal or lazy.

If you like my work, you can support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/zkldi). It goes a long way, and means a lot.
