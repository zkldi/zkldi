# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I code professionally and in my free time to try and make cool things.

I'm a fan of (and mainly use) TypeScript. Since late 2022, I've been writing a ridiculous amount of Rust for a secret project. It's coming along quite well. It's also an excellent language, and I love working with it.

For frontend stuff, I'm a svelte and react enjoyer. Svelte is nice and meshes with my head well, but React is purer and generally more powerful. I use both, but not on the same project.

Unlike other repositories on this list, Tachi is composed of many repositories (hence the massive technology list).
The [Main Monorepo](https://github.com/tng-dev/Tachi) subsumes the:
- Backend Server
- React Frontend (https://bokutachi.xyz)
- Core Types and Utils
- Database Seeds
- Discord Bot
- Thorough Documentation

Other Tachi related packages are external:
- [RG Stats](https://github.com/tng-dev/rg-stats)

## Other Stuff

- Editor: [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) with far too many modifications, `vim` when I'm stuck in a terminal or lazy.

If you like my work, you can support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/zkldi). It goes a long way, and means a lot.
