# Hello, I'm zk.

I'm a 22 year old programmer and rhythm-game enthusiast from Manchester.

Professionally, I work full-time with Python, TypeScript and dabble in some infrastructure stuff.
In my free time, I use TypeScript (Svelte, preferably) but perhaps more interestingly I'm working on a secret project involving a rather large amount of Rust. I'll have more to talk about in the near future.

Outside of programming, I read quite a bit, listen to a lot of music and boulder (poorly).

Cadence is a brutally strict ESLint config that results in clean, maintainable, less-buggy code.

## ![TypeScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/typescript/typescript_32x32.png) [Prudence](https://github.com/zkrising/Prudence)

A simple NPM package for validating objects against simple schemas. This was mostly designed for personal use, and was designed out of a dislike for existing solutions.

It primarily leverages first-order functions to get anything complicated done.
