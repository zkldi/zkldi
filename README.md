# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I code in my free time to try and make cool things.

I'm a fan of (and mainly use) TypeScript and Javascript, but I'm planning on learning some other lower-level technologies this year (Rust, Go seems cool too...).

# Live Projects

This is a list of projects that are currently released.

## ![TypeScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/typescript/typescript_32x32.png) Tachi
`tachi`

A supercharged Rhythm Game Score Tracker with a powerful public API. Of all the projects on this list, this is the largest, and best showcases my ability and workflow.

`prudn`

A simple NPM package for validating objects against simple schemas. This was mostly designed for personal use, and was designed out of a dislike for existing solutions.

It primarily leverages first-order functions to get anything complicated done.
