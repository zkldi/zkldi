# Q?

I'm 22 and write code for a living. And for a hobby.

More specifically, I guess it's correct to call me a "[rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) programmer" at the moment, as that's what I'm primarily writing, but I have some pretty strong experience in Typescript.

## Q?

Well, my main personal project at the moment is not public (East-Coast translation: "Stealth Mode").
It's not exactly unlike what I've done before, but I've definitely matured a lot as an engineer since starting it.
It's a year underway now, and will be a while before it's even worth showing to the world.

I'm pulling something like 50 hour work weeks on this alongside working a real job; the exact kind of nonsense you want to get away with in your early 20s.

## Q?

[Tachi](https://github.com/zkrising/Tachi) is the largest thing I've got publically released and contains a good 3 or 4 years of work.

While I wrote almost all of the code that powers the thing, at the moment I possess a sort of mangerial role over Tachi, spending more time reviewing PRs than writing any code myself.

Designing it so that other people can contribute and help out with something they legitimately personally care about is a big pride point for me. I've met some excellent friends from it.

## Q?

It is a rhythm game score tracker. That means that when people get scores in a game, they get ingested by Tachi and turned into nice dashboards and tables and graphs that people share with their friends.

Tachi boasts an impressive ratio of around 3000 users to 5 million scores. While it's not a lot of People, it's definitely popular within its niche.

# Q?

Outside of programming, I read and I exercise, mainly. I used to do a lot of bouldering but haven't bothered in a while. Not had the money or time.

## Q?

I'm a big fan of Pynchon, Wallace, those sorts, like... obsessively idiosyncratic, digressive, clearly mental.

## Q?

Isn't it obvious?
