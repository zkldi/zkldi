# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I code in my free time to try and make cool things.

I'm a fan of (and mainly use) TypeScript. I have some general knowledge of Go and Rust, but I'm not the best with them. I'm honestly looking for an excuse to use them on a project so I can get good with them.

For frontend stuff, I'm a svelte and react enjoyer. Svelte is nice and meshes with my head well, but React is purer and generally more powerful. I use both, but not on the same project.

`tachi`

Unlike other repositories on this list, Tachi is composed of many repositories (hence the massive technology list), including the [Backend Server](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-server), [Common Types](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-common) and [Thorough Documentation](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-docs).

`prudn`

A simple NPM package for validating objects against simple schemas. This was mostly designed for personal use, and was designed out of a dislike for existing solutions.

It primarily leverages first-order functions to get anything complicated done.
