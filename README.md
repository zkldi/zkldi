# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I code in my free time to try and make cool things.

I'm a fan of (and mainly use) TypeScript and Javascript, but I'm planning on learning some other lower-level technologies this year (Rust).

For my editor, I use a heavily themed build of ![VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

# Live Projects

This is a list of projects that are currently released.

## ![JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/javascript/javascript_32x32.png) [Kamaitachi](https://kamaitachi.xyz)
`ktchi`

A rhythm game score tracker. Designed with complete modularity in mind, it works near out-of-the-box for all games.

It is currently being rewrote, and powers just under a million rhythm game scores.

## ![JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/javascript/javascript_32x32.png) ![MetallicMind](https://github.com/zkldi/MetallicMind)
`mmind`

A discord bot which integrates with the Kamaitachi API. This is only currently used inside the Kamaitachi discord.

In the future I might release this application's skeleton as a discord bot framework.

## ![TypeScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/typescript/typescript_32x32.png) ![Prudence](https://github.com/zkldi/Prudence)
`prudn`

A simple NPM package for validating objects against simple schemas. This was mostly designed for personal use, and was designed out of a dislike for existing solutions.

It primarily leverages first-order functions to get anything complicated done.

## ![Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/python/python_32x32.png) ![Prudence Documentation](https://github.com/zkldi/prudence-docs)
`prudd`

The full documentation for Prudence.

## ![Javascript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/javascript/javascript_32x32.png) ![ESD-JS](https://github.com/zkldi/esd-js)
`esdjs`

A simple NPM package for calculating ESD and ESDC. This is a statistic used mainly in Kamaitachi, and (ab)uses central limit theorem to estimate the standard deviation of hits from a score.

# Live, Collaborative Projects

These are a list of projects that are currently released in which I have been a part of.

## ![Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/master/src/python/python_32x32.png) ![USCIR Specification](https://github.com/zkldi/uscir-spec)
`uscir`

A formal specification for ![unnamed_sdvx_clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed_sdvx_clone)'s Internet Ranking service.

Built in collaboration with ![ereti](https://github.com/ereti) and ![Drewol](https://github.com/Drewol).

# Upcoming Projects

This is a list of projects that are currently in development. The names for these projects are often up in the air and could be changed at any time.

What these projects do is kept a surprise!
