# Hello, I'm zkldi.

I code in my free time to try and make cool things.

I'm a fan of (and mainly use) TypeScript and Javascript, but I'm planning on learning some other lower-level technologies this year (Rust, Go seems cool too...).

`tachi`

A supercharged Rhythm Game Score Tracker with a powerful public API. Of all the projects on this list, this is the largest, and best showcases my ability and workflow.

Unlike other repositories on this list, Tachi is composed of many repositories (hence the massive technology list), including the [Backend Server](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-server), [Common Types](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-common) and [Thorough Documentation](https://github.com/zkldi/tachi-docs).

`prudn`

A simple NPM package for validating objects against simple schemas. This was mostly designed for personal use, and was designed out of a dislike for existing solutions.

It primarily leverages first-order functions to get anything complicated done.
